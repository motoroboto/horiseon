In order to make this site more accessable all around I wanted to enure that not only was it following a semantic HTML layout, but that it also was a little more adaptive to different screen sizes so it could be more easily viewed on a mobile device. 
There was plenty of redundant CSS that could be removed once the divs all had semantic class labels attached to them. 
I attempted to follow ARIA standards when adding alt tags to elements on the page, in order to make the page more accessible to people with disabilities. 
To this effect, from my reading it felt like all of the images on this page should have a null alt, as they all seemed to be decorative. None of them were nessecary for understanding the content of the page if a person was using a screen reader.
 However, if it is preferable to include alt text for the sake of this assignment I would be happy to add some.
